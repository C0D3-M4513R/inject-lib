# dll-inject
This is a small library intended to provide C bindings to the inject-lib crate.
It is by no means complete, and should not be taken as such.

This is just a small little demo, so that people can use my crate under many other programming languages, without having to create a custom wrapper crate.

For an example, on how to use this library I have included a small C example with CMAKE in examples.
