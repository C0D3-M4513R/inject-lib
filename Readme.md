Current Status: Looking for Maintainer (see https://github.com/C0D3-M4513R/inject-lib/issues/53)

This Github repo houses the inject-lib crate, as well as a wrapper crate, to provide a statically linked C compatible library for use in other languages.

For the rust crate go to [inject-lib](inject-lib).
For the C library source go to [dll-inject](dll-inject).
